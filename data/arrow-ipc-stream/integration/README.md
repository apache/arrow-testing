# Arrow IPC Integration "Gold" Files

These files contain data generated by well-known versions and implementations
of Apache Arrow. Unless otherwise specified, the implementation is Arrow C++
and the data is little-endian.

Nowadays, new gold files can be generated using the `archery integration`
command with the `--write-gold-files` option. More information can be found at
