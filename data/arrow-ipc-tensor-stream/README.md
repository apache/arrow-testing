# Arrow IPC Tensor Stream Format Fuzz Regression Files

These files contain Arrow IPC tensor streams, usually invalid, that used to
produce crashes or undesirable behaviour when ingested by the Arrow C++ IPC
reader.  Those files may contain data generated by fuzzers and may therefore
be hard to interpret by humans, but are useful as a fuzzing test corpus and
to avoid regressions.
