# Parquet Test Files

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ARROW-17100.parquet | Parquet file written by PyArrow 2.0 with DataPageV2 and compressed columns. Prior to PyArrow 3.0, pages were compressed even if the is_compressed flag was 0. This was fixed in ARROW-10353, but for backwards compatibility readers may wish to support such a file. |
| alltypes-java.parquet | Parquet file written by using the Java DatasetWriter class in Arrow 14.0. Types supported do not include Map, Sparse and DenseUnion, Interval Day, Year, or MonthDayNano, and Float16. This file is used by https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/38249 and was generated using the TestAllTypes#testAllTypesParquet() test case in the Java Dataset module. |
